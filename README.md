# note-taker-express
The modivation of this project was to use the dependencie express so I could creat a single page or multipage web applicaiton. What was leaned in this project was how to connect two html pages that can be used and share data. Also to see how routes can be used for connecting pages for the website. The problem I've ran into during this project was the db file and how to add and to add an existing statement for future use. I solved this by looking into documentation of how the db file works and functionality. 


# Installation
